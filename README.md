# Getting started on the Project Arcturus Shard

You will need to do the following to install Ultima Online and connect to Project Arcturus:
1. Download and install the official Classic Client
2. Run the uogo script
3. Open the similarly named ClassicUO client
4. Create an account and log in


### Download and install the official Classic Client

The official UO client can be downloaded from:

https://uo.com/client-download/

Install the Classic Client, let it patch fully, then close it.

### Run the uogo script

Open Powershell by hitting the Windows key and typing "powershell". Or probably just "power":

It will open a command line that looks like this:

Now paste the following line into it and hit Enter:

```Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ifeelrobbed/uoscripts/main/uogo/uogo.ps1'))```

It should look similar to this once it completes:

### Open ClassicUO

Either use the ClassicUO shortcut that should be on your desktop or navigate to:

```C:\UO\ClassicUO\```

And run ClassicUO.exe

### Create account and log in.

You should be at the login screen now. Just type in the username and password you want and click Login.

You should only have the ProjectArcturus shard listed. Click on it and click the green next button at the bottom right.

From here you will create your first character. Note that Elves and Gargoyles were added in later expansions. Human only for now. It should already be selected anyway.

Next you'll see a screent to pick a trade for your character. I imagine the default templates are fine, but I would recommend clicking on Advanced and picking your own skills.

In UO there are no levels. Your character has a skill cap of 700 and each skill you train can (and should) be raised to 100. So practically speaking, each character will ultimately have 7 skills. For perhaps the easiest start to get a handle on the game I recommend:
*Swordsmanship: 50 (So you don't get beat up by goats. Seriously)
*Magery: 50 (Though not mandatory, Magery is useful on any character. Even the biggest brute will appreciate spells like Recall to get around)
*Healing: 20 (You like staying alive right?)

I would recommend leaving stats as is, possibly shaving off 10 strength for intellegence if you want to dabble in spells a little more. I would not go lower than 50 though. Until you have a firm handle on the game you will heavily prize the "staying alive" stats and skills

Or you can do what you want. That's the beauty of UO, and you can always unlearn one skill and learn another. Though I'd recommend doing that before hitting 100!

Finally, you will pick your start town. Apparently New Haven is newb town? I wouldn't know. I'd recommend Britain. It's the biggest city in the game, has every shop, is centrally located, has a moongate nearby, mountains for mining nearby, sea access, you name it. Once you get a handle on the game, you can set up shop in any city you want. Or your own house.

Now you're in game. First thing, open the world map and find the bank. Go up to the bank and type "bank" and hit enter. Put your gold there. You will die. Don't die with all your money on you. You have 1,000 gold which allows for several oopsies as you learn what can and can't kill you.

Now from there, well, that's up to you. Head up to the graveyard and fight skeletons for a set of bone armor? Explore? Whatever you choose, the great thing about UO is that it's your choice. There is no guided themepark with scripted content. There is simply, the world. And the game wants you to live in it and make your way. So relax, don't ever feel like you have to do anything or your missing out. It's your goals, and your way. I hope you enjoy UO at least half as much as I do. You're in for a treat.
